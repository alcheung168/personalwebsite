<section id="security-plus" class="content-section section-certs">

    <h2>CompTIA Security+</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Security+</strong> certification covers practical, vendor-neutral security skills
      that map closely to how real networks are attacked and defended. It strengthened my ability to
      think like both an attacker and a defender while grounding me in security architecture and
      risk management.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Concepts & Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities:</strong>
        Reconnaissance, social engineering, password attacks, malware families, web application attacks,
        and how to interpret vulnerability scan results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security Architecture & Design:</strong>
        Network segmentation, DMZs, zero-trust concepts, secure baselines, and defense-in-depth across
        on-prem and cloud environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure Implementation:</strong>
        Hardening endpoints and servers, secure configuration of firewalls, VPNs, and wireless networks,
        and applying secure protocols such as TLS, SSH, and IPsec.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operations & Incident Response:</strong>
        Log analysis, SIEM concepts, incident response phases (preparation, identification, containment,
        eradication, recovery, lessons learned), and common playbook patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC):</strong>
        Risk assessment, qualitative vs. quantitative risk, basic policy design, and the role of
        frameworks and standards in securing organizations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Together, these areas help me reason about security controls not just as isolated tools,
      but as part of a coherent strategy for protecting networks and systems.

<section id="network-plus" class="content-section section-certs">
  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2>CompTIA Network+</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Network+</strong> provided the baseline networking knowledge I use in both my research
      and lab work—covering everything from physical media and topologies to routing, switching,
      wireless, and troubleshooting.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Concepts & Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Network Fundamentals:</strong>
        OSI and TCP/IP models, addressing (IPv4/IPv6), subnets, VLANs, and how data actually moves
        across wired and wireless links.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Network Implementations:</strong>
        Configuring switches and routers, static vs. dynamic routing, common protocols
        (ARP, ICMP, DHCP, DNS, HTTP/S), and basic WAN technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Network Operations:</strong>
        Monitoring performance and availability, using tools like ping, traceroute, packet capture,
        and interpreting logs and metrics to understand network health.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Network Security Basics:</strong>
        ACLs, port security, VPN concepts, wireless security modes, and how to place security
        controls logically within a topology.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Troubleshooting Methodology:</strong>
        A structured approach to diagnosing connectivity issues—identify the problem,
        establish a theory, test, implement fixes, and verify functionality.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This certification makes it much easier to design, reason about, and debug the networks that
      my security tools and research systems depend on.

<section id="certs-summary" class="content-section section-certs">
  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2>How These Certifications Support My Work</h2>
    <p>
      Network+ gives me the vocabulary and mental models to understand how packets move, where devices
      live in a topology, and how to troubleshoot when things go wrong. Security+ adds the attacker
      and defender perspectives on top—how to harden those networks, detect malicious behavior, and
      respond when incidents occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, these certifications underpin my work in <strong>IoT device fingerprinting</strong>,
      secure communication systems, and blue-team competitions by ensuring that my projects are grounded
      in solid networking and security fundamentals.
