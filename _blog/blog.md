    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <p>
      As the blog develops, my goal is to write articles that are both educational and approachable.
      Whether you're a beginner exploring cybersecurity or someone with years of experience,
      I want these posts to offer insight, curiosity, and a glimpse into the way I think through
      technical problems.
